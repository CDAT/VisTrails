UV-CDAT Git development policy v0.1

When working on a new feature or bug, first create a new branch off of the uvcdat-master branch. If it's a bug fix, include the bug number in the name of the topic branch. e.g.

> git checkout --track uvcdat-master
> git checkout -b bug_156_colormap_issues

Upon completing the bug fix or new feature and after local testing, merge the topic branch into uvcdat-next. e.g.

> git checkout uvcdat-next
> git merge bug_156_colormap_issues

After next has been fully tested and confirmed to be stable, it will be merged into uvcdat-master.
