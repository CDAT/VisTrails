From Release v1.3 build 1561

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed bug that was preventing files from being saved on Windows


From Release v1.3 build 1559

Changes:
 - Schema upgrade. Current version: 1.0.0.
 - Updated VTK libs to use 5.4.2 release
 - Removes conditional expression constructs, so that code runs on Python < 2.5.
 - Including Gridfields python module
 - Using only application single instance behavior if Qt 4.4 or later is 
   available
 - Added support for SubWorkflows (with no database support yet)
 - Added a Control Flow Package (see user's guide to see how to use it) and 
   related example files
 - Added support for basic package repository
 - Introduced a major reorg of the registry and related classes.  Specifically, 
   it adds serialization capabilities, and unifies the 
   core.modules.module_registry.PortSpec and
   core.vistrail.port_spec.PortSpec classes.  In addition, all configuration and
   drawing is done using PortSpecs (not Ports). It also includes revisions to 
   the PythonSource, and Tuple configuration dialogs, and adds controller code 
   to better support resulting updates. You can serialize the registry via the 
   "File -> Export -> Registry To ..." menu items.
 - Added support for "registry quickstart" which allows VisTrails to boot 
   significantly faster.  It also further changes registry behavior to allow 
   VisTrails to function without having access to the actual python modules 
   behind the ModuleDescriptors.  Everything can be done by tracing the 
   descriptor hierarchy instead of the mro, but we still use the mro when we 
   have it.  Try the quickstart by starting VisTrails normally and selecting 
   "File -> Export -> Registry To XML..." and saving the resulting file. 
   Then restart VisTrails with the -q flag followed by the registry file: 
   (ie "./vistrails -q <registry_filename>")
 - Use solid colors instead of textured backgrounds on graphics views, 
   since Qt (or pyqt) redraws much slower when these are enabled.
 - Improved layout of modules in visual diff and analogy
 - Added support for displaying thumbnails below the notes panel and/or as a
   version node tooltip. See Thumbnails Preference tab for changing specific
   options
 - Improved menu File organization
 - Added translate* methods for versions 0.9.3 and up, and updated code to use 
   them.  This should ensure that xml vistrails, workflows, logs, and 
   registries, can be updated when schemas change.  The idea is that you open a
   vistrail, and if it is not in the current schema, it is translated to the 
   current schema, no matter if you're using an xml-based file or relational
   database.  When saving the vistrail, the db code will attempt to translate 
   the vistrail to the schema of the database (even if it is an older version) 
   before saving.  For xml-based files, you may optionally specify to save the 
   file as an older version.  Currently, you are only able to translate back 
   to 0.9.3 (See menu "File -> Export -> Stable Version").
 - Added initial support for workflow debugging
 - Added the progress functionality allowing modules to show their progress 
   during the compute() by calling self.logging.update_progress(self, progress).
 - The VisTrails Console is now a dockable window. Also fixed a long-standing 
   bug that hitting enter when cursor is not at EOL will carry garbage to next 
   line. Fixed also a bug where if user types fast enough in the shell, the 
   input fails.
 - Added support for constants to generate custom hashes. The main current 
   usecase is File constants, which hash against filename and last-modified 
   times. The biggest consequence is that pipelines that use File objects will 
   now be smarter when it comes to files that change upstream, reducing the 
   number of times one has to clear the cache.
 - Improved the initialization of packages: if package fails during call to 
   initialize(), we report failure, disable the package, and continue 
   initialization. This allows startup process to continue. Also in preferences 
   pane, when package fails to load, we now display the error message; 
   previously, it just said "error". (There's still the problem of reporting 
   packages that load ok but fail to initialize)
 - Changed view behavior so that the initial pipeline view upon opening a 
   vistrail is reset.
 - Added support for importing workflows that have been saved as xml.
 - Added a function to change parameters from the api along with a function to 
   find modules by name (and package/namespace if specified). Note that the 
   param_list in change_parameter requires a list of strings---the serialized 
   representations of the parameters!
 - Updated the gen_vtk_examples scripts to create better pipeline 
   specifications.
 - Added pc3 package for the Third Provenance Challenge.
 - VTK package:
   + Added support for Picking in a VisTrails cell. By default, the 
     vtkRenderWindow contains a picker. The 'p' key activates the pick test in 
     the render window.  A new vtkPicker can be attached to the VTKCell to 
     modify the picking behavior according to the mechanism provided by VTK.
   + All VTK Filters are registered to show their progress while executing
   + Added support of InfoVis to VTKCell. Notice that the saving camera feature 
     does not working with InfoVis (because there are no direct SetCamera port 
     for InfoVis classes).
   + Added support for changing the backgorund color of a vtkRenderer using 
     color widget
 - Spreadsheet:
   + Added exporting images and echo mode feature
     
Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed bug where queries with multiple sources would fail in query by example
 - Spreadsheet:
   + Jpg/gif/png images can be correctly displayed on the spreadsheet
   + Fixed many interaction bugs
   + temp files were not being correctly removed
 - VTK state changes with statically overloaded parameters are now handled 
   correctly. Typical example is vtkTreeMapView::SetLayoutStrategy
 - Fixes a  bug where the configuration wouldn't be setup properly for a new 
   .vistrails directory.
 - Fixed plot.vt example to work with matplotlib version >= 0.98.5.2
 - Catch exceptions when writing file to raise dialog box if there is an error.  
   This fixes bug that nothing was being shown to the user in case of a bad 
   write (ie, file permissions insufficient).
 - Fixed PythonSource syntax highlighter error and (yes!) there's a line number 
   for debugging now.
 - Fixed startup "bug" when package with dependencies fails to load
 - Copy/paste is relative to the current canvas
 - Shipping the GPL License in the distributions
 - ImageMagick package:
   + Added CombineRGBA class, configuration object, and fixed GaussianBlur bug
   + Removed requirement check that prevented the package from loading if
     ImageMagick was not found in the path  
 - Bug fixes in Windows installer: 
   + Installer always creates desktop shortcut and uninstaller did not remove 
     all pyc files
 - Other minor fixes
     
From Release v1.2.1 build 1336
Changes:
 - Schema upgrade. Current version: 0.9.3. If you keep vt files in a database,
   you have to upgrade the database as well
 - VisTrails now requires Qt 4.4 or later to run
 - Adopted application single instance behavior (only one version of the
   VisTrails application can be executing).
 - Added Interactive expansion and collapsing in the version tree: the three
   lines on edges in the version tree that used to represent multple
   versions has been replaced by a plus symbol. Clicking this symbol
   expands the link to show all the versions in betweeen (though this may
   change to only a limited number later).  A minus sign appears on the
   top of a list of untagged, non-branching, non-selected versions that
   will collapse that list.
 - Added descriptions to the version tree.  They show up in place of
   a tag if one hasn't been set, but with a thinner italicized font.
   Double-clicking on the node allows it to be changed and turned into a tag.
   Showing a description for each action that is now displayed in the
   properties overlay. This description is still very simple (eg.,
   Added module), though in the future it might make sense to save off
    more detailed descriptions for each action in the db (eg., Added
    vtkRenderer module)
 - Added new items to the View Menu to show and hide branches and nodes
 - Restored the "Clear Recent Searches" in the search box in the version
   properties
 - Added command line options to execute workflows and show only 
   the spreadsheet when opening
 - Logging information is now stored in .vt file
 
 Bug fixes:
 - Copying and Pasting dynamic modules, such as PythonSource threw an error
 - File version was not set correctly
 - Fixed a bug in analogies that sometimes corrupted vistrails files.
 - Fixed some bugs and annoying behavior with autosave.  A dialog
   now prompts the user if they want to load autosaved data.  This
   dialog appears when opening a file or starting up vistrails.
   Autosave data no longer is loaded when the user creates a new
   vistrail by pressing the new button.
 - Dragging versions to the spreadsheet is working again
 - Dragging a spreadsheet tab created a window that couldn't be closed
   or put back. A floating sheet can be docked back by simply closing it or
   dragging it back the spreadsheet tab bar (if exists) or just the window
   itself.
 - There was no obvious way to exit full screen mode in spreadsheet. The
   fullscreen mode can be closed either by:
    * Pressing 'ESC', 'Ctrl-F', 'F11' or 'Alt-Enter'
    * Right click on the fullscreen mode and unselect 'Fullscreen'
  - Border color of selected cells in the spreadsheet is now consistent
 
From Release: v1.2 build 1263
Changes:
 - Version tags can be edited directly by double-clicking the tree nodes
 - Added basic support for package management on Fedora Core through YUM
 - Added compatibility with Qt4.4
 - Added support for dynamic addition of modules in packages
 - Pipeline, Query and History views are now reset with Ctrl+R 
  (Command+R, on a Mac) so that it does not interfere with version text
  items 
 - Add a transparent overlay to the version viewer that shows the 
   selected version's properties.  By default this is turned off, but 
   can be enabled under the view menu.
 - Added standalone functions that help third-party applications that 
   need an API into VisTrails, located on vistrails/api directory.
 - Improvements in the command-line for both non-interactive and interactive mode:
   + Added support for executing more than one workflow at a time
   + Included support for opening a vistrails from the database
     Now a version (tag or id) can be specified in the command-line
     together with the filename (or vistrails id when opening from the 
     database). 
 - Added support for opening special vistrails files (.vtl files) on 
   the web (wiki integration)
 - WebServices package: added support for loading wsdl urls automatically
   when opening a pipeline using them


Bug fixes:
 - Improved handling of faulty packages
 - Vistrails having groups with annotations or functions did not open
   correctly
 - Query display didn't ghost module fill
 - Query execution and reset didn't update pipeline view
 - Connection line was drawn twice in query canvas
 - Editing parameters in query mode was cumbersome because of 
   bad focus management
 - Fixed database support to pipelines with groups
 - Fixed "Add Database" dialog confusing behavior
 - Fixed a long-standing bug on PythonCalc where ModuleError was 
   being called without the self parameter
 - HTTP Package: slightly better error handling with malformed URLs
 - Improved general GUI performance when changing versions, including
   Undo/Redo

   setting per-module _input_ports and _output_ports fields and 
   per-package _modules field (see teem package at www.vistrails.org)
 - Removed graphviz dependency
 - Ability to export workflow and history views to PDF
 - In WevServices Package: Improved support to web services using
   complex types 
 - Added a BooleanWidget, so Booleans are now given by a checkbox 
 - In VTK Package: 
   + Added Transfer Function Widget
   + Added dataset inspectors, special vtk modules that allow users
     to easily query bounds and scalar range of an object.
   + Added support for vtkTIFFReader to allow volumetric (slice-based)
     reads.
 - Added support for grouping modules in pipelines
 - Incorporated many optimizations in the code
 - Added namespace support to packages

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed analogies
 - Version tree was not refreshed when analogy was applied on the spreadsheet
 - Fixed double drawing of module names and version node names on the mac
 - Added support for running Visual Diff for pipelines with 
   PythonSources and other modules with a local registry that 
   have different input and output ports
 - Changed the behavior of selecting new cell locations on the
   spreadsheet when it is full (cycling vs. using always the first
   cell)
 - Fixed bug where options passed through the command line were
   written to the startup.xml file

----------------------------------------
From Release v1.0.1 build 1063 
Changes:
 - In VTK Package: Exporters now take a VTKCell as input when exporting 
   the scene
 
Bug fixes:
 - Caching mechanism: VTK modules didn't take the connections into account 
   when deciding whether to cache or not. This is related with the error
   message "function expects 1 argument, got 0 instead".
