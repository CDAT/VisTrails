Issues:

When the user closes vistrails or uses command + q to quit, the close event
doesn't seem to be passed to vcdat so we won't execute functionality that we 
want to run before we close vcdat.  Right now the only thing we want to do 
when we quit is to kill the process that is running the editor to view the 
teaching commands if it exists.

Any operation that relies on data from a defined variable such as 'altered 
weighted average' doesn't work because the vistrails module must have access 
to all of the defined variables to execute these commands and it doesn't have
that yet.

Clicking on the plot will show the tooltip but the tooltip will disappear very
fast.  Right now there is a hardcoded wait(1) so the tooltip shows up for 
1 second, otherwise the tooltip usually doesn't appear.
